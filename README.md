Because the project will be presented in the form of animate, the photography, as an art technique with a history of more than 100 years, is also the origin of photography and animation. I think it will greatly help the presentation of the project. As a technique that freezes the changes in the picture on the screen, long exposure is well-matched with the expressive form of animation. The most classic form of long exposure photography is star trails. The star trails in the night sky have a unique geometric beauty.

2.Coding Technique Exploration

Flutter Sort Visualizer

![flutter_sort_visualizer](https://github.com/JaegerZzz/tzho0413_9103_tut02/assets/145730865/1ae6f733-ed21-4b9b-b624-d7467a1367f1)
Through different sorts, it is possible to simulate the movement of different star trajectories during long exposure and leave traces, ultimately becoming part of the animate, simulating the entire long exposure photography art. In the process of geometrically regular motion and final sequential sorting, it is like the trails left by stars in a long exposure photograph, which can visualize the entire process of the long exposure star trails and reproduce the shooting of star trails.
